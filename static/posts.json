It is maintained by Facebook, Instagram and a community of individual developers and corporations. React is intended to help developers build large applications that use data that changes over time. Its goal is to be simple, declarative and composable. React only handles the user interface in an app; it is considered to only be the view in the model–view–controller (MVC) software pattern, and can be used in conjunction with other JavaScript libraries or larger MVC frameworks such as AngularJS. It can also be used with React-based add-ons that take care of the non-UI parts of building a web application.     According to JavaScript analytics service, Libscore, React is currently being used on the homepages of Imgur, Bleacher Report, Feedly, Airbnb, SeatGeek, HelloSign, and others.",
